title: Getting back into it :(
---

Earlier this year I changed hosting provider, had a new VSlice with Windows Server 2008 R2, SQL and all the wizz bang stuff. But within 3 weeks of setting everything up, everything went down, and I lost everything. Apparently the VM corrupted and couldn't be recovered. Not only that I made the mistake of thinking "hey, you know what, nothing bad will happen for a while, I'll setup backups next month". Only something bad did happen.

I've since moved host again, and am now hosted with MammothVPS with proper backups. So hopefully it doesn't die again.

It's pretty depressing to lose everything, I lost a couple of projects I had spent a couple of years building that had only been live a month or so. So depressing it put me off wanting to blog anything. So hopefully I can get back into it again.

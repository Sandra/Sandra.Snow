title: My must have (short) list of programs/extensions etc...
---

It's been 1 year since I posted my [list](http://www.philliphaydon.com/2012/03/my-must-have-short-list-programs-and-extensions-etc/) , well.. 1 year has come and gone, and I missed posting this on the same date. None the less its April now and here's my post.

### Visual Studio 2012

I'm still a .NET Dev but ah... god it's painful going back to VS 2010... The new Black Theme makes this so much easier to use while sitting in the dark. 

### Still using

- [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)
- [Mindscape Web Workbench](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products/web-workbench)
- [BugAid](http://www.bugaidsoftware.com/)
- [ILSpy](http://wiki.sharpdevelop.net/ilspy.ashx)
- [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

### Raygun.io
<http://raygun.io>

This Software as a Service for Error Handling has replaced my use of ELMAH. It's simply amazing. Been tracking errors in my applications more closely with this.

### Metro Studio 2
<http://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio>

This is a free program which is rather handy, it allows you to create icons for use in XAML. Been very handy while creating my Windows Store App.

### MarkdownPad 2
<http://markdownpad.com/>

Since moving my blog to GitHub Pages, and writing everything in Markdown, this program is awesome. Great for being able to preview the parsed content before committing it.

### RavenDB
<http://ravendb.net/>

RavenDB is now on V2 and I really wish I could use this in the workplace, it makes life so much easier and I believe using it has made me a better developer.

### NancyFX
<http://www.nancyfx.org> / *project I currently contribute to*

NancyFX is a micro web framework, well not so sure it's `micro` anymore, but it's definitely smaller than MVC/WebForms. This is another framework I really wish I could use in the workplace. Makes working with the web a dream.

### WorldDomination.Web.Authentication
[https://github.com/PureKrom....Web.Authentication/](https://github.com/PureKrome/WorldDomination.Web.Authentication/) / *project I currently contribute to*

This project I created with Justin Adler, is an attempt to make OAuth easier to implement, by taking away all the `magic` and making the `magic` straight forward and easy to understand. I think we've done a pretty good job and David Fowler has given us great input to make even better. It's currently being used by JabbR

### JabbR
<https://jabbr.net>

This is a chat-room created by David Fowler, built on SignalR, NancyFX, and WD.Web.Authentication. It's a great place to get help from other .NET developers and help others. Quite a few OSS projects like Service Stack, Nuget, NancyFX, etc all have rooms there, so it's great to get direct contact with the project authors.

### MightyMoose / NCrunch
<http://www.continuoustests.com/> / <http://www.ncrunch.net/>

I'm still torn between these. Like em both...

And that's it, I haven't really changed much over the last year.

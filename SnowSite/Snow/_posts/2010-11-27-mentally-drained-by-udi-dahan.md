title: Mentally Drained by Udi Dahan.
---

I'm on my first day of recovery after attending [Udi Dahan's](http://www.udidahan.com/) [Advanced Distributed Systems Design using SOA & DDD](http://www.udidahan.com/training/#Advanced_Distributed_System_Design). Needless to say I think I'm still in shock.

Udi must be one of the best presenters I've come across, I always thought he talked a little slow when watching videos of him presenting, but it's an entirely different experience when you're sitting in a room listening to him.

He really makes sure you follow and understand, at no point did I feel like I was left behind. Something that intrigued me however, was there was not one question he could not answer... He must have heard every possible question because people started trying to catch him out with some weird example or scenario, and he was able to answer it.

I thought a there was a few people who struggled a little bit because they spent a lot of time trying to apply what they were learning to their current projects or applications like it was something they could slap on the side and benefit from, or they would think about the entities involved and how it would map to a database schema. Thinking like this makes the concepts really to understand.

The course is amazing, Udi is a wealth of knowledge and 5 days just isn't enough time to download all the information in his head, but that 5 days is like 5 years worth of experience. All that"s left is to take what I've learnt and put it into practice.

I highly recommend going to this course even if you have to take unpaid leave and pay for the course out of your own pocket, it's well worth every cent.

100/10!

Last night I attended the [Sydney Alt.Net](http://sydney.ozalt.net/) user group since [Udi Dahan](http://www.udidahan.com/) was attending. There was no specific topic, it was an open questions/answers session with Udi. If you're interested you can watch it [here](http://sydney.ozalt.net/2010/11/november-meeting-recorded-for-your.html).

The thing that interested me most was to do with [NServiceBus](http://www.nservicebus.com/) commercial support (*1 hour 23 minutes in the video if you want to skip ahead*). Initially I thought that it was going from Open Source to requiring a license, a license I wouldn't be able to afford for my hobby projects, however someone asked about the licensing.

As it turns out NServiceBus is still completely Open Source and Free, you can download the source code, compile it, and use it with no restrictions. However you must support it yourself, and use the community for support/help. While the paid licensing model is to allow companies to download stable tested binaries with commercial support.

Great news, now I can download it and play around with the latest trunk and look at integrating it into one of my projects. Learning is funs :)

title: Blog Update to WordPress w/ SqlSrv
---

Over the past few days I've moved my blog from BlogEngine.Net to WordPress, since BlogEngine is fail.

I didn't go with a hosted solution since it costs money just to use my own domain name, infact it costs more to use my own domain name than it cost me to register the damn thing. So I investigated blogs and came across:

<http://wordpress.visitmix.com/development/installing-wordpress-on-sql-server>

Seems someone or somepeople have ported wordpress to work on SQL Server, so people who are on Windows with SQL Server and don't want to use FailSQL MySQL can take advantage of wordpress.

As much as I hate PHP after moving to .Net, the one thing the PHP community did right was all the different CMS and Blog solutions out there, something the .Net community lacks. As far as I'm concerned there is not one good .Net blogging solution available.

Anyway so far I'm happy with the move.
